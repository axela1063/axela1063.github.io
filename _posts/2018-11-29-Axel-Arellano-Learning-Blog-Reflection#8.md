Taking the midterm was very hard, I struggled on some questions and other I found them easy. One of the questions I found easy is listed below

7. Which function application matches the following contract? 

        #show-score :: String Number String Number -> Image 

(a)show-score("Red Sox","Cardinals",5,5)
(b)show-score("Red Sox",6,"Cardinals",4)
(c)pick-flavor("Vanilla","Oreo","Mint")
