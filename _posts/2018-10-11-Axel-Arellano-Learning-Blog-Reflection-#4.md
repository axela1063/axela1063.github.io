This week we were mostly working on our flag projects and getting to start them. On monday we started working on our flags, but not on the 
computer we first did an example using construction paper, glue, rulers, and scissors. First we had to go on the computer and go on google
and search up *our flag name* construction diagram. Then we had to draw that diagram on a piece of paper using the measurments that we saw 
on the diagram. After we had to pick pieces of construction paper that were the color of our flags and construct our flags based on our 
diagram.
