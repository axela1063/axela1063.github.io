I made this website finally it was very hard to do and took a lot of work. This week I started to finish my website, I was having a lot of trouble because I had a lot of files named the wrong thimg. Once i got the website up and running I felt very proud because it took me sometime to figure out. I feel that my computer class is a lot fun, and it is helping me understand how to create animations and websites. The class itself is preparing me for a possible carrer in technology because I want to do something involved in technology/coding. This week in class we learned how to create a samll animation and how to. One challenge I am expecting to face is making a large scale animation, making a video game will be hard because I would need to create many different algorithms to do many different things and if I mess up one file I need to check and fix the rest.
