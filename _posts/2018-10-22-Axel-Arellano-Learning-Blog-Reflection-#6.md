  On monday we came into class and talked about data sciennce and what it is, we then transfered to the computers and worked om a pyret code Mr.Allate made, we had to then write a statement about the code and what it does. Mr.Allates codemade a table of shapes and their corners. We were then given the task to make three more rows, the task was preety easy because the pattern was the same. We also had to make another colum which was also easy because the pattern was also the same. We learned about catagorial, and quantitative and whate they mean. So far the obly connection I can think of is that a table has a header like an html file.
