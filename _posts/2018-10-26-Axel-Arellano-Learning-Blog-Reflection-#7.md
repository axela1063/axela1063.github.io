  This week was all abour contracts and what they do. Monday: we came into class and started talking about checking data, and contracts. We learned how to inport it into functions. We learned how to describe the function, how to correct it, and how to expand our thinking about  it. I didnt have trouble writing the checking functions. Tuesday: we came into class and started the warm up which was to define the difference and similarities of the expressions given, we figured out that the difference was the number, and everything else was similar. Defining functions are abstractions over expressions. Wednesday: the warm up was to define the contract given, we werent able to do much because we took 47 minutes on a 20 minute discusion. I feel that we could've done better.
