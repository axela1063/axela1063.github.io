  On monday we learned how to connect representations to patterns. Patterns are concepts that we want to connect too.  We also did an excersise on how to style our websites with CSS, we learned about CSS syntax and what it does, we also learned how CSS syntax format looks. On tuesday we learned about tags and what they do. Tags have both an opening and a closing tag, tags with a / in the front "</html>" are the closig tags. On wendsday we looked at an animation and what it looks like. We talked in about the first person who had the idea of the computer and how pyret code came from racket code and racket code came from scheme. On thursday we started looking at flags, we are going to create a program that will represent the flag of a country, we learned that vexillology is the study of flags and symbols. We also learned that the program should speak the language of the problem your trying to solve. So far I am enjoing the class and think that it is going to help me advance in technology to eventually have a carrer in that field of study.
